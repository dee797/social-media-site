<h1 align="center">Flitter, a parody social media app</h1>
<br/>

<p>
    This repository holds the source code for Flitter, a parody of a certain social media site that used to feature a blue bird, but has now been rebranded as the 24th letter of the alphabet. Flitter is a full stack web app with a separated frontend and backend; it offers client-side rendering and routing, and fetches data from the backend when needed.
